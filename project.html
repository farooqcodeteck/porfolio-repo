        <h2>My Projects</h2>
        <p>During my bachelor’s degree, I undertook and successfully completed two pivotal projects. The first was a mini project focused on developing a voice assistant application, designed to streamline user interactions through advanced voice recognition technology. The second was a major final-year project, where I worked on an innovative solution for Alzheimer’s diagnosis using 3-D brain imaging. This project aimed to enhance early detection and diagnostic accuracy through the application of cutting-edge imaging techniques.<p>

            <h3>Alzheimer Diagnosis Using 3-D Brain Imaging</h3>
            <p>Introduction of NMF-TDnet Approach:
Developed an advanced method, NMF-TDnet (Non-negative Matrix
Factorization with Temporal Dynamics network), specifically designed for 3-D
brain imaging.
The approach utilizes a sophisticated network structure, enhanced by
layerwise convolution, to analyze complex brain data with unprecedented
accuracy.
Key Innovations:
Network Structure & Layerwise Convolution:
Integrated a unique combination of network architecture and convolutional
layers, allowing for deeper, more nuanced understanding of brain patterns.
This innovation enables the system to identify subtle markers of
Alzheimer's disease that were previously undetectable.
Efficiency Improvement:
Achieved a 40% reduction in processing time, significantly accelerating the
diagnostic workflow.
The streamlined process allows for faster interpretation of imaging data,
leading to quicker clinical decision-making.
Accuracy Enhancement:
Set new benchmarks in diagnostic accuracy, ensuring early detection of
Alzheimer's with higher confidence.
The method's precision in identifying early-stage Alzheimer's makes it a
valuable tool for clinicians.
Integration with SVM for Enhanced Precision:
Integrated NMF-TDnet with Support Vector Machines (SVM), a robust machine
learning technique, to further enhance diagnostic precision.
The hybrid system leverages the strengths of both NMF-TDnet and SVM,
resulting in superior diagnostic outcomes.
Impact on Alzheimer's Research and Diagnosis:
The introduction of NMF-TDnet represents a significant advancement in
Alzheimer's research, offering a new standard for 3-D brain imaging analysis.
The combined approach of NMF-TDnet and SVM has the potential to
revolutionize the early diagnosis and treatment of Alzheimer's, ultimately
improving patient care and outcomes.</p>
